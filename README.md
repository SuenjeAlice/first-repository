The project is comprised of two parts, one solved in the labs and one solved at home during the Easter holidays.
In the labs we completed different kinds of exercises with the help of the lecturer  and at home we had to complete two exercises on our own. 

To clone the repository from your GitHub account to your computer you have to open the GitBash command centre (which you can download on https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
First you have to decide where to save the repository, you type in the command "cd /c/users/<username>/<location>", eg "cd /c/users/g00363332/downloads", then you initinialise the PC by typing in the command "git init".
You clear any old repositories by using the command "rm -rf <repository-name>". Afterwards you clone the repository by typing in "git clone https://github.com/<GITHUB USERNAME>/<repository-name>.git". Lastly you change the saving location to the repository ("cd <repository-name>").

If you made changes to the repositroy and want to save it on GitHub you have to push it up by using the following commands: "git add .", "git commit -n "insert a message here"" and "git push" after this you are prompted for your username and password.

To run the exercises you open Index.java in TextPad, you press ctrl + 1 to compile the file and ctrl + 2 to run it.
This opens the file in the command centre and then you can choose the different exercises from the menu. 
This menu is also continued to a separate menu which includes all the extra exercises I completed that weren't necessary.
